# **Interactive Frontend Development Stadium Finder Project**

The website can be found at: https://darrenmcgill35.github.io/milestone2/

## *What does it do and what need does it fulfil?*

For my Second Milestone project I chose to design and code a Google Maps API site that is all 
about helping the user organise and navigate to watch their team throughout the sporting season. 


## *Functionality of project.*

The website is fully responsive. It is a single page website with buttons on the main page to 
direct you to the Fixtures, Map and social icons. 

The Fixtures section will tell the user who their team is playing and more importantly the venue. 

Once the venue is clicked you are directed to the map with icons telling the user where, in my 
opinion the most important facilities needed when travelling to a sporting event. i.e - ATM, Parking,
Bus/train Stations and bars/restaurants.

The Jumbotron changes for each venue with Capacity info, Sat Nav Coordinates and a button to 
The GAA website to buy your tickets. 

All social icons are functional and direct the user to three different 
pages. 


## *UX*

This website is designed and created for a wide varity of people.
Responsive design was important as members of the public could check locations, buy 
tickets and check results on their mobiles or tablets when they are on there way to games.  

Click on the directory [user-design-experience](https://github.com/darrenmcgill35/milestone for all the Planes, 
including User Stories, wireframes, mock-ups, diagrams that I created as part 
of the design process.

## *Testing*

The site was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, 
testing its functionality as well as look and feel
(in landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, S6, S8, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, 
iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. 
All links were tested. 

I validated my HTML with WC3 Validator,

Result - Code is syntactically valid.


## *Deployment*

1. The Website was coded in AWS Cloud 9 IDE. 
1. A local GIT directory was used for version control. 
1. It was then uploaded to GITHUB using Ubuntu / Bash script. 
    * git add . (Adds files to be committed)
    * git commit -m "Initial commit" (for first commit and every other commit 
      thereafter a comment about what was changed ie. 
      "Updated footer in index.html")
    * git push (This command is used to upload local repository content
      to a remote repository.)
    * Input username and password (Once this is done correctly all files will 
       be available in the software development platform GITHUB)
